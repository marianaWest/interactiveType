This program was made with the JavaScript library canvas-sketch. It creates a dynamic rendering of the key pressed by the user. 
It was part of a course on creative coding.

## What I learned  
During this project I learned about methods and properties of the Canvas 2D context that are specific to text, for example: 
- the textMetrics interface and its properties (actualBoundingBoxLeft, actualBoundingBoxRight, etc.);  
- textAlign property;  
- measureText() method.
